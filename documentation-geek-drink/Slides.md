## The Power of Documentation

----

| Docs Effectiveness | Title |
| -------- | -------- 
| Good | Jurassic Park |
| Bad | Memento |
| Bad | [John's Terraform Notes](https://gofigg.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~62390a2fee1b5a007027ab57/pages/1579745329/Terraform+Notes) |
| Good | [Miles' Marketplace Restart](https://gofigg.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~miles.maddox/pages/104331714/Restart+Marketplace) |


----

# Jurassic Park:
> Summary: Island theme park of real dinosaurs. What could go wrong?
- Centralized Document Repo (in the storage room)
- Easily read by all skill levels (John Hammond and Malcolm)
- Precise - able to not only step-by-step Ellie through process, but *navigate* her there too

----

# Memento
> Summary: Protagonist suffers from amnesia, and compensates by leaving himself notes and clues.
- 3 different documentation types (notes, pictures, tattoos(don't recommend for work docs))
- The engineer himself can't discern what he's talking about

----

# John's Notes
- Only useful to John
- Could be several individual, searchable docs
- Adds chaos
- No flow

# Mile's Notes
- Easy to read
- Flows
- Searchable

## Elements of Effective Documentation

----

[Github:](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/best_practices.html)
1. Minimum Viable Documentation
2. Update docs with code
3. Delete Dead Documentation
4. Documentation is story of your code

---

[Google Source:](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/documentation_best_practices.md)
1. Minimum Viable Documentation
2. Update docs with code
3. Delete Dead Documentation
4. Prefer the good over the perfect
5. Documentation is story of your code
6. Implementation state determines document repository
7. Duplication is evil

---

## Documenting Best Practices
Implementing the Elements

----

- "Stream of Conscious" notes
- Have a public dumping ground
- Review and then ask your team or manager for specific feedback (if you think it's necessary)
- [Strong Commits](https://www.microverse.org/blog/how-writing-meaningful-commit-messages-helps-you-be-a-better-developer)
`OPS: Currently creates module to create anomaly detection against every account and optionally a stack. [SRE-1488]`
`[type] [optional scope]: [description] [optional body] [optional footer]`

---

## Conclusion
- John's Personal Style:
  - Uniform Commit style
  - Document everything, clean up later
- Do you have any must-have rules?
- How do you document today?
- Would you rather have poor docs or no docs?
